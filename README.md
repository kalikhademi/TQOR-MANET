# TQOR-MANET

We simulate the performance of TQOR [] which is a recently proposed Trust-based QoS-Oriented Routing protocol (TQOR) in cognitive MANETs. 

The simulation has been implemented in the discrete event simulator OMNeT++ (version $4.4.1$). We simulate TQOR in INET framework (version $2.3$) of OMNeT++, under AODV protocol.

The simulation setup can be set in omnetpp.ini and params.h files.

For experiments, simply run the omnetpp.ini file and choose AODV protocol. All the results are recorded INET framework log flies.
