# TQOR-MANET

We simulate TQOR [1] which is a recently proposed Trust-based QoS-Oriented Routing protocol (TQOR) in cognitive MANETs. 

The simulation has been implemented in the discrete event simulator OMNeT++ (version 4.4.1). We simulate TQOR in INET framework (version 2.3) of OMNeT++, under AODV protocol.

Once you donwloaded and setup OMNeT++ and INET framework, download the zip files and replace the following folders in the project for both protocols TQR and TQOR separately:

1) replace folders "manetrouting" and "ipv4" in the "networklayer" folder in the "src" folder of inet framework.
2) replace folders "application" in the "src" folder of inet framework.

The simulation setup can be set in omnetpp.ini and params.h files for each project in the corresponding "manetrouting" folder.

For experiments, simply run the omnetpp.ini file and choose AODV-UU protocol. All the results are recorded in INET framework log files, or in "results.txt" in "AODV-UU/examples" folder of the project, which is user created log-file.
